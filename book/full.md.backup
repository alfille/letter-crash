# Full Alphabet

The game is not just a single letter, but an alphabet of *M* letters, with restarts after any crashes.

To solve, we'll use a general "recurrence" approach:

\\(Quantity = \sum_{i=0}\^{M-1}p_{win}\^ip_{loss}(i\\,q_{win}+q_{loss}+Quantity)+p_{win}\^M(M\\,q_{win})\\)

This means:

* We sum over all the lengths of *wins < M* with then a loss
  * chance is \\(p_{win}\^i\\,p_{loss}\\)
  * contribution to whatever quantity is
    * i * wins
    * 1 loss
    * Game expected quantity (for restart)
* and add the *M* straight wins case
  * chance \\(p_{win}\^M\\)
  * M  wins*
