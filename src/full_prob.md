# Full Alphabet: Probability

We expect this to be *1* since the game rules are to keep restarting until a victory

From [our initial analysis](full.html)

\\(Quantity = \left(\frac{1-{p_{win}}^M}{{p_{win}}^M}\right)\left(q_{loss}+\frac{p_{win}}{1-p_{win}}q_{win}\right)+q_{victory}\\)

where
\\(q_{win}=0\\)

\\(q_{loss}=0\\)

\\(q_{victory}=1\\)

So: 

\\(P=1\\)

since none of the intermediate values contribute to the final probability.
